I called personal analytics and collaboration (in making things) “Future” here because as big as they are, they are still changing. New technology means new ways of creating stories are still appearing. It’s still especially early in brands aligning with either of these. The stories of an Internet of Things might come after this, but it’s too far off to say for sure.
