I got this email today in my Ryerson email account.  I don't know if I'm more embarrassed that a person would ask such a pointless and ridiculous question to the whole program and includes his contact information in the email (it is a very stupid question), or that the department actually sent out this email to all ITM students at Ryerson.

Looking for Ryerson's most popular student:

My name is Rodney xxxxx and I am a Ryerson student writing an faculty article. I am looking for Ryerson's most popular student, which means you have over 1,000 friends on Facebook or Twitter or send over 100 text messages every day. If you know anyone like this, feel free to call me on my cell at 416-434-xxxx.

Thanks!

Rodney xxxxx

Fax: (416) 979-xxxx

This is just embarrassing.

Remember, this is Ryerson University, the school that wants to be the new silicon valley, tech start-up, innovation oriented school. Maybe the guy wants to write a smart academic article, but that's not the tone I get from this message.

Is this the direction to expect that Ryerson's venture into social media going to go?  Forget the whole community and relationship part of it all... "Who's the person with the most friends? That's all I really care anything about"
