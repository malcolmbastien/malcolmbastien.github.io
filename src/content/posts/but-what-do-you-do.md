I was reading over the email I got from the guys at StartMeUp Ryerson who recently announced their short list of 5 top entries in their business plan competition. Next week the five companies will be pitching their businesses and plans for a chance to win $25,000.

My buddy Daniel Patricio's business Orange Rhino Media is one of the finalists, this is the short description of what ORM does:

Orange Rhino Media is a digital marketing company with an understanding of how to leverage new technologies to drive results. We develop web applications and execute and manage social media marketing campaigns. We are currently beta testing our web application - Pinpoint Social, the toolbox for social media monetisation.

That's pretty good I think. It describes what sort of company they are, what types of projects they work on, and what their current focus is.

Then I came to the description of YoPromo...

"Yo!Promo was founded in August 2009 and has been working on building our web and mobile technology since then. Most recently, we have been working in the Ryerson DMZ, collaborating with other Ryerson students. We are initially launching within the next month in Toronto, with the view to expanding to other urban centres in the coming months."

I have no clue what they do. I can't even pinpoint the broader industry they're in. Hopefully their business plan and their final pitch will communicate it better than that.

*P.S. Another finalist is Damn Heels which to be honest out of all the businesses I've seen come out of Ryerson, this is one of the best brands.*
