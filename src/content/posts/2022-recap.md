The year passed by quickly, and it's challenging to come up with a list of my accomplishments over the past year. Aside from some other minor achievements that I won't bother listing, only a little stands out about 2022. In any case, I'm proud of the work that I did.

## Workshops

Since the pandemic started, I have attended many workshops in the last few years. Many workshops that would have required me to travel moved online, making attending more sessions much easier.

- [Domain Storytelling](https://kalele.io/training/domain-storytelling/) with Stefan Hofer
- [Enterprise Services Planning](https://kanban.university/kanban-development-path/esp/) with David J. Anderson
- [EventStorming Facilitation](https://ti.to/EDDD/eventstorming-facilitation-virtual-workshop-nov-2021) with Paul Rayner
- [Fast Flow of Change](https://kalele.io/fast-flow-of-change/) with Susanne Kaiser
- [Flight Level 2 Design](https://www.flightlevels.io/workshops/flight-level-2-design/) with Cliff Hazell
- [Specification by Example](https://www.avanscoperta.it/en/training/specification-by-example-workshop/) with Gojko Adzic

Although I'm glad to have taken these courses and was able to fill some gaps I felt I had, in total it was weeks of training, and I'm relieved there aren't any more courses on my to-do list.

## Miro Templates

Early in 2022, I went on a kick between February and April, publishing five different templates to the Miroverse. Each template is a workshop or meeting tool I've used with my teams. Some are lightweight templates for facilitating team retrospectives, while others are more involved and deeper explorations of value streams or services.

- [Squad Health Check](https://miro.com/miroverse/squad-health-check/)
- [Lean Waste Retrospective](https://miro.com/miroverse/lean-waste-retrospective/)
- [FlowStorming Workshop](https://miro.com/miroverse/flowstorming-workshop/)
- [Service Maturity Mapping](https://miro.com/miroverse/service-maturity-mapping/)

## Blog

In the latter part of the year, I cracked open the blog I started in 2007, which was last updated in 2013 and wrote seven posts. It's not a lot, but I'm happy to have another outlet to express myself aside from the short-form thoughts I often post to [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@malcolm).
