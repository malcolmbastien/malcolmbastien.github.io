The right amount of laughter mixed with agony builds teams

I started doing CrossFit at the end of April 2011, and as soon as I started I began a routine of training five times a week after work. Soon after, once my contract at Microsoft ended in June, I started to pick up on my reading, write more on the blog (in August especially), but I continued training everyday. It’s been a few months that I’ve been looking for a job now, and the other day I started to realize how much of what I’m looking for in a job are present in training CrossFit.

There’s a shared language that you develop
There’s theory and learning to do behind the scenes
There are all three of Dan Pink’s pillars to motivation: Autonomy, Mastery & Purpose
There’s agony mixed with laughter which builds teams
There seems to be an approach to work/life balance that is blended rather than separated.
There’s very little bullshit.
CrossFit is the only thing I’ve found where I can work hard, bust my ass all week, and still have an urge to go at it again on Saturday or Sunday which are supposed to be rest days.

What’s funny is that when people ask me if I care about fitness, or in being in shape, I never ever know how to respond. Do I enjoy doing the workouts? Maybe. They really are hard! What’s gratifying is completing workouts, and being able to talk about that experience with others who have done it.

I’ve always been picky and held a high standard for where I’ve chosen to work, though I’ve never been able to describe what I was looking for. Turns out it’s these qualities I desire in a job, and it just so happens they are foundational to CrossFit.

On January 14-15, 2012 I’m going to be taking the CrossFit Level 1 Trainer Course. We’ll see where this goes.
