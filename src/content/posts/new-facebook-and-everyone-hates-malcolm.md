**Skip all the theoretical talk of trends in micro-messaging and the mass adoption of [Twitter](http://twitter.com).**

Here are some examples of angry responses I've gotten from friends who apparently have a problem seeing all my Twitter updates go through Facebook into their stream:
Why is there like 5000 updates form you on my feed!? Malcolm is breathing in, malcolm is breathing out, malcolm is...AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
You're lonely... I get it man... but come on... shut the fuck up for a second. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH
AHAHAHAHAHAH

You're a good sport, Sport... :)
There was also this status I picked up

(*which was later followed up by...*)

Why follow a trend as oppose to start your own. Honestly, you could start the trend of leading all the people who are following the mundane trend of a bridge or cliff or rooftop and make the world a little more exciting. I'll support you in your endeavour and cheer you and the whole crowd following crew the entire way. So grow a pair and lead them into a bottomless abyss and save the world from such idiocy.
I always feel lucky to have friends such as mine...

**The new Facebook layout has been up for maybe 5 days so far? This is going to be a lot of fun...**
