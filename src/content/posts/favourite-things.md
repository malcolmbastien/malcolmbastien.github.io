# Favourite Things

What goes on this list:

- Things I use regularly    
- Things I have that I like that people might not find on their own
- My favourite and recommended things related to my hobbies and interests

_Note: Anything linked to Amazon is an affiliate link, but sometimes you can find things cheaper elsewhere._

## Technology

- **[Elgato Prompter](https://amzn.to/4lTUih4)**
- **[Shure SM7B](https://amzn.to/44XBea8)**
    - When you get a Shure SM7B, one of the benefits is that you never have to worry or think about buying another microphone.
- **[Sony Alpha ZV-E10](https://amzn.to/4oegXWU)**
- **[Sigma 16mm f1.4 Lens](https://amzn.to/4f5tR5a)**
- **[Panasonic Clip Headphone](https://amzn.to/3ILjYxz)**
    - These are super cheap. They're are very light, so it's comfortable to wear them for long periods. They hook around your ears, so you don't get the impression commonly left by wearing headphones. They are over ear and open, so you don't get that discomfort or feel the pressure you usually get when sticking earphones in your ears. The only hassle is the cord.
- **[UGREEN MagFlow 15W Wireless Charging Station](https://amzn.to/3UkTVA1)**
    - It's a significant change, not having to muddle around with charging cables.
- **[Horus X – Blue Light Blocking Glasses](https://amzn.to/45kYnVs)**

## Apps & Services

- **Obsidian**, free
- **Monkeytype**, free
- **[Readwise Reader](https://read.readwise.io/)**
- **[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/)**

## Controllers

- **[Azeron Gaming Keypad](https://www.azeron.eu/)**
- **[BIGBIG WON Blitz 2](https://amzn.to/4lKQoXv)**
    - The grip isn't just on the bottom of the controller, but wraps around the sides where most of the contact is made with your hands. The buttons have a satisfying mechanical click, while not being too heavy. The TMR Electromagnetic joystick won't drift, and are fully rubberized and have a textured grip. Finally, there extra triggers of the top and bottom. Important to note is that the triggers aren't analogue. Just like the buttons, they use mechanical micro-switches.
## Typing
- **Sofle Split Keyboard**, $140 (Case only)
- **[Graphite Keyboard Layout](https://github.com/rdavison/graphite-layout)**
- **[Akko V3 Lavender Purple Pro Keyboard Switch](https://amzn.to/456FzrP)**
    - A very smooth tactile switch.

## Pens

These pens all write well, are ergonomic to write with and have a sturdy construction.
- **[Pilot Dr. Grip Gel Pen](https://amzn.to/4odtNEU)**
- **[uni-ball Jetstream RT Ballpoint Pen](https://amzn.to/3TZvDv2)**
- **[Pentel EnerGel](https://amzn.to/4l5tTeR)**
- **[Pentel EnerGel Alloy](https://amzn.to/4micQap)**
- **[Uni Alpha-Gel Jetstream Ballpoint Pen](https://amzn.to/410p1kb)**

## Bags

- **[tomtoc Laptop Backpack](https://amzn.to/419o3lq)**
- **[tomtoc Travel Backpack 40L](https://amzn.to/3ISafFH)**

## Fitness
- **[Rogue Kettlebell](https://www.roguecanada.ca/rogue-kettlebell-e-coat)**
- **[Perfect Fitness Perfect Pushup Elite](https://amzn.to/4lQ0Mxt)**
    - I thought these might be a bit gimmicky, but having the longer range of motion for my push-ups at this point feels very natural. Regular push-ups now feel restrictive and awkward.
- **[Ice Shaker Stainless Steel Shaker Bottle](https://amzn.to/4mAtDWz)**
    - I've tried a lot of water bottles and shaker bottles, and the Ice Shaker bottle is in its own class. The bottom is rubberized, as is the rim which makes it easier to open. The lid is suphttps://amzn.to/419rUioer functional with both a loop and secure snapping cover.

## Home

- **[Samshow Sink Plunger](https://amzn.to/419rUio)**
- **[Squatty Potty](https://amzn.to/3TVOabI)**
- **[Purple Pillow](https://amzn.to/470B70b)**
    - It's a very heavy pillow that has a very unique feeling.

## Other

- **[Xpand No Tie Elastic Laces](https://amzn.to/46ucAAD)**
    - I put these on all my shoes.
- **[Henson Shaving Razor](https://amzn.to/3GMptLX)**
