I've done a lot of talking about learning from the comments.  I think one thing I may have missed is describe why comments provide such a good learning opportunity.  It's because all the other ways we as students learn and are graded is by our ability to memorize facts.  Comments provide a different way for us to take concepts and engage with ideas.

From reading about ideas, thinking about them, and getting practice at communicating our thoughts, blog comments are a very powerful tool.
