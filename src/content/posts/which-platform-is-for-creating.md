The position of the PC industry is that the Post-PC era won’t really happen because PCs are still the best tool for creating and collaborating. They say that Phones and Tablets are great consumption and communication devices, but that you can’t use them for real work.

Here I feature a selection of five recently aired PC television ads with four iPad ads.

I’ll let the ads speak for themselves.
