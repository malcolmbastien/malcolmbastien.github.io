**Get Excited About Blogging.**

That's what happens when you attend an event like WordCamp Toronto.

When I used to do [Capoeira](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira), yearly events would be held in Toronto or Montreal that I would go to.  At these events people excited about capoeira would come together, some of them beginners and some who had been practising it for over 20 years.  It was a chance to talk to them, and a chance learn from them.  But most importantly it renewed the excitement that everybody had for the art.  Training and training would be hard to do for long periods of time, and everyone would have a rhythm of feeling really good one month, but in the next would not have a good rhythm or would get discouraged.

What I felt at [WordCamp Toronto 2008](http://wordcamptoronto.com/) was that same renewal of excitement.  Being the first time attending such a blogger-centric event, meeting and talking to other newer bloggers, or probloggers got me excited about it.  It was a perfect example of a community coming together.

Thankfully [Mark Wood](http://www.markwood.ca/) ([@markfox](http://twitter.com/markfox)) recorded each of the presentations and uploaded them to the net for everyone to share. And hopefully, other people might watch these videos and feel a bit of that same excitement and feeling of community that was present at the event.  Here are just some of my favorite WordCamp Toronto videos, which can all be found on [Mark's Vimeo page](http://www.vimeo.com/user783833/videos/sort:newest).
