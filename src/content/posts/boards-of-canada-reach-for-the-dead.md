[Boards of Canada - Reach for the Dead (from Tomorrow's Harvest) - YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=2jTg-q6Drt0#!).

I can't express how excited I am for Boards of Canada's new album, Tomorrow's Harvest to come out. Ever since Graham introduced me to Boards, their music has been an anchor for me. I listen to them if I ever need to tune out of the world and focus (often), or just for late night relaxing.

Boards of Canada basically got me through university as well. I played Boards religiously on the many nights I spent in front of my computer with a cup of tea studying, writing, or programming. The two albums Music Has the Right to Children and The Campfire Headphase both have a special place in my heart.
