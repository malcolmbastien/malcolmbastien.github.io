*If I had asked my customers what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse more fuel efficient internal combustion engine.

I had this thought a couple of days ago, when are we going to admit the need for bigger leaps forward, not just in theory, but in legislation, and in manufacturing. Sure guys like GM go bankrupt, they take a bunch of cash from US tax payers, and then they start a whole new series of commercials, with a “it’s a new GM” attitude, but they spew the same sort of deals and work the same math hoping for different results.

Forget having plenty of cars on the roads with real fuel efficient engines, forget the auto industry entirely. Where else could you apply the same lessons of the past (ie something along the lines of this famous quote by Henry Ford I edited) to what we’re facing today?
