Amazing what you can do these days, like tether your iPhone for internet over 3G to your laptop then call people on Skype while you're driving down the 400 up to the cottage.This is how that would look like :)
 Looks like Josh will have a good time while he's gone for Thanksgiving weekend. ![http://malcolmbastien.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/screen_shot_2009-10-10_at_2-58.png?w=300](http://malcolmbastien.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/screen_shot_2009-10-10_at_2-58.png?w=300)
