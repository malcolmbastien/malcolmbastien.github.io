I have just posted a new version of the SimpleText for Mac client. It runs as a status menu item, and allows you to sync a directory of text files on your Mac to the [SimpleText.ws](http://www.simpletext.ws) web service. This version brings in a number of changes:

 **Added** User’s Guide
 **Added** AppleScript to sync and chnage user account.
 **Changed** No longer uses MacFuse, stores synced files on local filesystem.
 **Changed** Local filesystem layout supports multiple user accounts, so full resync no longer needed when changing accounts.

To get the new version run SimpleText for Mac’s build in software update, or download it directly from this link [download link](https://simpletext.s3.amazonaws.com/SimpleText-Development.dmg).
