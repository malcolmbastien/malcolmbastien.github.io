Everybody loves these right?

Gary is “completely motivated by gratitude”
Knows what it’s like to not have stuff
“You have to do everything right, not just one thing”
People “underestimate our ability to appreciate effort”
“I think people respect effort”
“What I don’t do wrong is that I genuinely care about people”
Gary will write a book on root beer. He’ll review a different root beer everyday for a year.
The one piece of not-obvious advice: “The big game is patience”
The P.P. theory: Patience & Passion
“We’re under rating the Internet”
“Desperation is a scary, scary powerful thing.”
The ones who turn desperation into inspiration are the one to watch out for.
Customer expectations shift.
Expectations towards things like receiving responses from brands and celebrities online are changing.
This shift in customer expectations is going to become a big trend.

And one more time, let’s celebrate that DemoCamp 24 was the 4th anniversary of DemoCamp in Toronto!
