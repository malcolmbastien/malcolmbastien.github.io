If Dvorak is an alternative keyboard layout, then Colemak is an alt-alt-layout.  Designed to be easy to learn for QWERTY keyboard users, the Colemak keyboard layout has a lot going for it as far as being not only a better keyboard layout for typing, but also one that people might even be compelled to switch to!

Colemak was designed after the QWERTY and Dvorak layouts were designed. In fact, of the three, **it's the only keyboard layout that was designed after computers were invented.** The Dvorak keyboard layout is excellent for typing English, but it wasn't designed for how modern computers work, and even though ZXCV might not be important for writing, they are common keys for the way we all use computers.  The Colemak layout keeps those key in the same position as the QWERTY keyboard layout, which might reduce its effectiveness for writing, but at the same time that also lets us use those common shortcuts (If you're just joining us: Undo, Cut, Copy, & Paste) more easily than on Dvorak.

I switched over to Colemak after being a Dvorak typist for two years, and even though Colemak is only marginally better than Dvorak (both are vastly superior than the QWERTY layout) I decided that **a small increase in productivity is still an increase in productivity**.** **Because that's what the purpose of a good keyboard layout is, as seamless as possible a way to input data onto computers.  **Good keyboard layouts help you type faster and ****be more productive** (You still need to put in the proper time for practice and training though). If not to help you type faster, which many people can already do using the QWERTY layout, at least to let you continue to type fast without destroying your wrists.

Not to get too philosophical, but if you've become more of a content producer online, type at a computer for most of the day, or like to try your hands at any life hack that could save you time, I hope you try switching to a more efficient layout.  There are a lot of life hacks being written now on using different tools and applications, or different desktop environment modifications to do etc... but why not pay the same attention to the method in which you interact with and transmit information 95% of the time?It's actually a fun way to challenge yourself and to relearn a skill.  After all, starting from scratch is sometimes the only way to improve.  It is literally like starting from scratch at 15 characters per minutes for the first little while.

If you're really geeky and would like to dig into some data and stats related to keyboard layouts and typing effort measurements, check out [Carpalx](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/).  It has data for all the popular English language layouts, and custom fully optimized layouts.
