Blogging and long-form web writing will be around for a long time.  Even if readership drops and people start spending more and more of their time on Twitter and Facebook, for the authors Blogging will still be relevant to them.  I want to extend an idea written by Mark Evans in which he talks about the decline in attention blogs are getting

Mark Evans wrote a post called Blogs: The Honeymoon is Over, in it he says:
A growing number of people, who used to spend a lot of time reading blogs, are spending time with Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube and, of course, their e-mail. The reality is people are becoming digitally stretched, and blogs are getting less love these days.
That is all true.  Blogs are no longer as exciting as they once were, people care a lot less about Technorati rankings and don't find it relevant any more.  I want to extend Mark's idea and say that as the most popular thing online or not, there will always be enough of a population that cares about blogging that people will keep it relevant.  Here's the comment I left to his post:
I think you're proving a point right now about why blogs will still be around in the long term.  Even if people go from reading 700 blogs a day down to 0 and focus all their time on twitter and Facebook, for the blog author there is still no better way to explore an idea if only for his or her own personal self education.
When things change at the pace the web enables, people interesting in those topics can't learn new concepts so much from short-form content like Twitter.  Blogs are the place to explore new ideas and to discuss possibilities, to respond to one another and to bring in rich media into the discussion.

The more I describe this boring but important future for blogging, the more it seems to me like blogging will become the academia of the web.
