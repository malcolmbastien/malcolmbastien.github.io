This week I'll be giving a presentation to students following a series on a new "Enterprising Canada".  It's an idea that visiting professor at Ryerson, Gerrard Kennedy, came up and has been promoting as a new way of looking at entrepreneurship in Canada.  In my perspective, the whole idea can be described as being an entrepreneur and creating new opportunities in Canada while at the same time adding to the social bottom line.
