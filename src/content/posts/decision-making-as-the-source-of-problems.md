I frequently get asked to help teams solve problems, but most of the time the problems are self-inflicted, caused by managers making decisions in the attempt to achieve some short-term goal.

Thing would be much better off if managers just started off by asking their teams "What should we do?" or "How could we achieve this goal?"

Managers don't have the best solutions, and neither do the teams. But when they talk, share and work together, a better solution can be found.
