I chatted with Justin from Refresh Events last night about conversation that he started over Twitter about event overload in Toronto.

*** Update:** Just to be clear about some strangeness that happened on this post earlier today (sep 29th). I had took down the post at Justin's request earlier in the afternoon. It stayed down for about 5 hours until I got another message from Justin asking me to put it back up. I did this at his request. Just wanted to be clear and transparent about that. - Malcolm*
