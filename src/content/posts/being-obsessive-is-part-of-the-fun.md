My last post was a whole big comparison that I spent more than a day on (for doing all the research) about the general pros and cons of Tumblr vs Posterous.

Now, I really really like Disqus for my commenting. For the past year even I’ve been using external, third party commenting systems on my other blog, openmode.ca (malcolmbastien.com “classic”). I just don’t think I can switch back.

I find that without the richness that Disqus provides, both commenters and myself lose out. Try to find a blog posting with more than 11 comments in a regular commenting system that doesn’t try to hack in comment replies into it, where people who can’t contribute choose to just type in “+1 to Martin” instead of commenting, or when conversations become fragmented.

In addition to all the points above both Disqus and IntenseDebate have become very good at giving a commenter identity on the web and the choice/power to comment in many different ways, and to extend their comments onto the social web with various options for doing that as well.

In short, my internal dialogue is about complete as I choose to shift most of my blogging activities over to Tumblr.

I’ll be missing out on the very interesting and innovative new life-streaming that Posterous is bringing (really bummed about this). But I’ll also get to keep using my comment enhancing partner Disqus (hopefully also a beneficial in net to the blog).

To be honest Tumblr does have a very rich and complete iPhone app. The Tumblr app does lack the amazing photo gallery feature of the Posterous app, but it has all it’s bases covered which I like and which gives it a very nice dashboard/homebase sort of feel.

I think the more I blog about blogging, then maybe the more other people will actually blog and spend less time on Twitter (in someways the internet’s new idiot box).

I feel like I’m rambling. I’m done.
