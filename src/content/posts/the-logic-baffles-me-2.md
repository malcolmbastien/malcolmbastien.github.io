*“I now have read and assessed the work term reports for WKT400 & 502, and by receiving this message you have received a “pass” for your report or reports.*

*However, this is a “broadcast” notification to all students in the ‘07 Intake group and if your report was deficient and did NOT receive a “pass”, you will have been notified by an e-mail message to you personally in which case this notification does not apply to you.”*

So I get a message saying that I’ve passed, unless I’ve not gotten another email telling me that I’ve failed, in which case I should disregard this message?

*“The employers’ reports on your performance on the job generally have noted an overall rating of at least ‘good’ with most of you receiving the overall rating of ‘excellent’.”*

Overall, you were all graded as having at least ‘good’, and at the same time most of you got the overall rating of ‘excellent’?

I hate university.
