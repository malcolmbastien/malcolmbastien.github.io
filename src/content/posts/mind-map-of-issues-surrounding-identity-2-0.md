**Issues surrounding Identity 2.0**

Here is, for your viewing pleasure, a mind map I was working on Tuesday afternoon for my Identity 2.0 research essay.  There's a lot in this mind map, but I thought people might just appreciate taking a look at it.  Now for some indexable data, here's a breakdown of the main points on the graph:

The 7 Laws of Identity + Privacy =

The privacy-embedded laws of identity

More direct control of data

Information minimization

Detect fraud

Separation of digital identities

Types of identity systems

Invisible

Proprietary

URL Based

Card Based

Centricity

Enterprise centric

Federated

Hybrid of Enterprise/User

User centric

User in control

Identity Technologies

Identity Meta system

Portfolio of identities

Will connect together separate systems

Shibboleth, SAML, .netPassport, CardSpace, [LID](http://lid.netmesh.org/wiki/Main_Page), OpenID

Why?

Social/Writable web

User needs

Business needs

Entrepreneurial opportunities

Technologies

Today's systems:

Siloed

Identifiable data

Identity "One-offs"

Open standards

XMPP, RSS, OAuth, APML, OpenID, OPML

Groups

Companies

[Digg](http://digg.com), Facebook, Yahoo!, Plaxo, Microsoft, MySpace, [Linkedin](http://linkedin.com), Google, Six Apart

Hackers

Data Portability

DiSo

Autonomo.us

Franklin Street Statement

These are basically the tree branches, but there's some more useful information to be found in the mindmap near the ends. I hope this has been somewhat helpful.
