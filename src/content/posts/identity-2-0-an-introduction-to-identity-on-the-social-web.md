Last night I finished a course at Ryerson where I wrote a research essay on the topic of identity systems and how the issues of identity exist as part of the new social web.  I feel like the essay is worth including on the blog and sharing because of its attempt to be a clear, and thorough introduction to the issues of identity and privacy.

I'm not an expert on the topic and hopefully the information I've included is accurate, and informative to readers.

I'm not going to try and sell this essay and tell you why you should download it. Two people you should Google if you are interested in this topic though are [Dick Hardt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Hardt), and [Kim Cameron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_S._Cameron), two people whose work provided me with a lot of insight as I first started learning and getting into the topic of [Identity 2.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_2.0).
