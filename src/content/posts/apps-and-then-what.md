Read into the Apple iPhone and iPad ads and you'll see that the heavy focus on apps is used to show people how they could use those devices in their lives. Its a good idea. These devices are so new, you can't ask people what they want because these innovative apps haven't ever existed before. It's the same logic as to why when Apple released their first computer they couldn't ask people what they wanted. Nobody could imagine it.  But enlightening through apps isn't sustainable, or is it? What happens when people have that knowledge?  The mass population is still so unfamiliar with smartphones and tablets that apps are serving the primary purpose as a vehicle of explaining how they could use those devices in their lives. Given a 
hypothetical situation where every consumer knows the benefits of and understands smartphones and tablets, what do apps drive after that?

Maybe at that point being shown hundreds of apps is less enlightening, and becomes overwhelming for users. By that point users are no longer looking to be amazed by apps, instead they want to get work done and do their jobs.  Sort of like a shift from "Wow! That's neat!" to "I've seen stuff like this before. How can it help me?"  On The Desktop Think about the way your non-technical friends and your parents use computers. How much desktop software do they buy? What desktop software do they really use that's not included wwith their operating system? They've probably gone years without installing anything else.  So that's one option: After a certain point, people will no longer be in love with new apps. After they've already accepted smartphones and tablets into their lives, more apps will eventually distract them from what they want to do with their devices.  The other possibility, is that people will only get more excited about apps. That renewed love of discovering ans using new apps will move beyond only their smartphones and tablets.  They'll be looking for app experiences on their desktops and laptops that match the experience on their phones.  Maybe people have always wanted to use apps the way they do now, but it's always been too hard. It's been too hard on every platform. To hard to find them, to hard to buy them, to install them, and to hard to use them.  Now, more people than ever before have the skills to filter out A-grade apps from the bullshit ones. They are also losing patience for doing it way desktop operating systems have done it so far.
