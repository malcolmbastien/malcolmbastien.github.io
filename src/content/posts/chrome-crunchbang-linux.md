      Chrome really makes Linux netbooks much more usable. On netbooks, using cloud services just makes sense. The problem is that Firefox is dreadfully slow and for me it would lag my entire machine. Now, chrome makes using apps like Google Docs, Google Calendar, and even things like Hootsuite very smooth, even on this modest hardware.
 

The way Chrome can now apply the active GTK+ theme at the click of a button is pretty freaking sweet as well!
