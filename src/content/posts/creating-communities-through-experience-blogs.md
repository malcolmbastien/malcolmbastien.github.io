Getting out of the mindset of advertising and direct promotions is important. Neither activity are enough to move customers online. One thing I am seeing that looks promising is the creation of experience centric blogs. Blogs created for, and blogs written by, the people that live and breath the brand experience.

These blogs don't need to written by company employees, and they don't need to be blogs about products. The idea of experience economies comes across strongly in experience blogs, that products and services both take a back seat to the economic power available to companies that deliver customer experiences.

Two examples I've seen include Dell's [Digital Nomads](http://www.digitalnomads.com/) blog, and Citrix's [Work Shifting](http://www.workshifting.com/) Blog.

There's a couple neat things that these blogs do, that would be a good example for others to take note of for in the future.

Instead of blogging about the companies products, create blogs for the experiences created by the companies offerings for their different customer segments. Just like a laptop company enables businessmen to work on the go, the same tools also enable students to take their learning with them outside the class and into the real world, or how a webcam company enables different customers create more rich connections with others online.

The blogs don't even need to be written by people at the company. Sure you can give the impression that your corporate culture, or employees care about the products or experiences delivered, or in connecting with customers, but often there's overhead. What seems to give these experience blogs a running start is the identification and acquisition of already blogging, community figures that live and breath the experience delivered. Get them to blog, get them to be ambassadors of your brand experience. They come, batteries included with an audience, and the skills needed to blog successfully.

Even if blogging is considered an older piece of social media, there's a lot of opportunities for companies's products and services to communicate with their customers, and not be pretentious, by exploring this space. There's a lot of space that companies share with their customers, but not many of them have begun take advantage this higher level of connection they already share.

Are you trying to promote your products or service? Or have you begun to celebrate with your customers the experiences you are providing? To what extent are you even giving your own customers a platform to express their own love for those very experiences?
