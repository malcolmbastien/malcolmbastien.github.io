There's been a lot of talk about how in down-times like these when you might be having a hard time finding work, that investing in yourself is the best thing you can do.  Which I say is absolutely true.  I want to try and take the idea a step further with a practical resource on how people can go about doing that. By no means will this be a thorough guide, but instead a starting point. This can even become a live resource.

I want you to contribute if you can: ideas, books, blogs, people, tools, and technologies that might be important or that someone else could find useful.

There's a few different categories of investing in yourself we can define, I'm going to initially break it up into three sections: Your billable and employable skills, your personal network and the community of people you have around you, and the processes you have in your life that you use to manage your time and be productive.  These turn into your skills, your personal network, and your productive habits.

## Skills

You can have a better chance of finding work, and be able to charge more by increasing your expertise in a particular field or a skill.

***Update:** I should note that the skills I refer to are largely focused on technical and web skill, if you have ideas on other skills people will find useful add some in the comments.*

### Programming

10 Most Sought-after Skills in Web Development

How great is it to know what skills are most likely to find you work?  The order of the skills in this article don't matter nearly as much as having an idea of what people are asking for and then going to work to improve.

The list basically breaks down like this:

 - Web frameworks (Django , Rails, CakePHP , Code Igniter )
 - Widgets
 - Custom CMS themes
 - CMS Customizations and plugin development
 - PSD to XHTML services
 - Javascript Plugin creation
 - Facebook/MySpace applications
 - iPhone applications
 - Ecommerce integration
 - Flash and Actionscript Knowledge

Again the order of the list doesn't matter so much, if your current expertise is in ecommerce systems, don't think that you need to re-invent yourself as a CMS theme designer.  Although if you're expertise is not on that list, and you see trends that your skills will eventually be obsolete or not in demand, its important to evaluate when the best time to switch might be.

### Web Analytics
