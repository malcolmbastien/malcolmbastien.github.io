[http://www.youtube.com/direct](http://www.youtube.com/direct) I like this a lot. It opened up my eyes to something as well.

New media wasn’t changing old media. As of now new media was there as something old media was trying to respond to. They tried to offer content for free in different ways, they tried to be more rich, they tried being more social. But they were trying to impose themselves on new media.

I think YouTube Direct reverses that and in a way unlike a lot of others, is a system to inject itself into old media, and have direct change on it.

I sort of picture old media being this person who is trying to protect themselves from a virus by injecting themselves with what they think is a vaccine, but it’s futile and they get more sick everyday. But eventually that fails, and the virus becomes strong enough that it takes over the person’s entire body. But they don’t feel sick anymore, they in fact feel stronger than ever. Because they acted resistively trying to protect themselves from the virus (even if that meant being exposed to a little bit of it) rather than embrase the virus and let it take over their bodies completely.
