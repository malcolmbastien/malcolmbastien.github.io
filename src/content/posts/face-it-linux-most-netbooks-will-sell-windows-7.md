And they will sell **well**.

 People all over the place are kidding themselves.  One of which include Brian Proffitt.  I tried to write a comment in response to his article talking about Linux's competitiveness on Netbooks given that Windows 7 can run on netbooks (thanks for turning off comments on your blog but leaving the comment form live by the way) but resorted to doing a full post instead.  With this news that Windows 7 will run on netbooks, people are concentrating on all the wrong ideas, and doing absolutely nothing helpful to aid in the real future of Linux on the netbook.

One of Brian's points is this:
"..**cost will be the big factor** in how well each OS  succeeds... the financial headlines and their own accounting books will quickly convince them that **the biggest profit margin** is the way to go."
There's two big pain points I have with this quote.

## Why A Free OS Won't Sell - You Still Have To Pay

The first excerpt completely takes a stake to not only what people in the Free Software Foundation preach, but to Linux adoption in general of the past 3 years.  **End users don't give a crap about cost** (thanks to the topic being specifically netbooks we don't need to concern ourselves with corporate or enterprise Linux).  Telling people how great Linux is because it's free [as in beer] is the worst way to convert computer users, its never really worked.  It's also impossible to convince them when what they are buying is a bundle. Getting people to base a $300+ decision on "this one costs $40 less" when they've never used Linux before is a horrible idea.  It hasn't worked this far, netbooks won't be any different.

## Companies Won't Look at Profit Margins, They'll Look at Profit

Bundling Linux with netbooks will save manufacturers a couple bucks a shot. Great.  They'll need that savings when **nobody buys their product.** Like my point above, buying a new netbook is not the right time to get people to use Linux for the first time.  If the laptop next to you is selling with Windows 7, spending your $300 on a slightly cheaper system with "this Linux thing" is a riskier purchase.  But that doesn't even consider the elephant in the room: Microsoft advertising department.

### Microsoft Will SELL Windows 7 on Netbooks

Microsoft won't only put windows 7 on netbooks and then put them into stores.  If Microsoft thinks Linux on netbooks is catching on with consumers, what's stopping them from investing millions into advertising the Windows 7 + netbooks combo?

That powerful campaign to sell by Microsoft kills the argument about companies caring about profit margin in the end, and that's because there's going to be more **profit** to be made from a product that **sells.**

## Linux Finally Has Focus, Leave it Alone!

Didn't we all just realize a little while ago that arguments based on price don't convert?  And when that happened, emphasis was put into investing on important things like user interface and design, product quality etc... Let's not start a discussion on how the netbook wars will be played out any differently using this old strategy.

Let's just charge marginally more for Linux systems than Windows, and then say it's "Like OS X".

**If you have any thoughts on this at all, whether I'm right, or whether you think I'm full of crap, let me know by leaving a comment.**
