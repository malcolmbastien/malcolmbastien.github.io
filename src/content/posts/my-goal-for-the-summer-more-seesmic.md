Here's my first of many more [Seesmic](http://seesmic.com) video blog posts and recordings. I really would like to use Seesmic more and communicate much more through video as a summer goal of mine.

As a brief overview for this video, I discuss:

- How video is a richer way to connect to people
- How this richness is a way to even better develop personal brand
- How Seesmic and video still has a lot of potential as a communications medium in social media.
- Just how much Seesmic, Loic le Meur, and Gary Vaynerchuk are all very cool.

Hope you enjoy.
