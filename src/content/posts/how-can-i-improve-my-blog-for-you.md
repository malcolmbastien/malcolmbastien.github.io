I enjoy my blog. I enjoy being able to dive into my thinking on social media and better define the images of new ideas that I have.

At the same time I want to make my blog **a better place for you**. I want the content to be interesting for you, for you to get value out of, a place for you to get new ideas and new perspectives.

**... But is that what you want?**

Help me understand what I can do to make this blog a better place for you, the visitor, the reader, the commenter. There are so many different questions I want to ask, but I know that there's some different that you want to say.

Leave your feedback for me in the comments, or using [Rypple](http://rypple.com) (Don't worry, it's anonymous): [http://www.rypple.com/malcolmbastien/openmode](http://www.rypple.com/malcolmbastien/openmode)

**Thank you.**
