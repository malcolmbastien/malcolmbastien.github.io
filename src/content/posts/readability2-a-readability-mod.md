> I’ve [mentioned Readability before](http://minimalmac.com/post/179631823/readability-an-arc90-lab-experiment), while not Mac specific, it is the best way to remove advertisements, flash, etc. from any webpage  and get the main content in a clean and easy to read page. That said, there is always room for improvement.

> Readability 2, built upon the original, aims to do just that. Stripping even more away yet building in some improvements. It started as a project to make a better clipper for [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/) then the one they provide. In my findings, it does a better job on some pages for sure. Worth a look.

> This cool bookmarklet basically strips away all the graphics of a site, and changes the CSS to the font of the content you want to read is nice and… readable.
