I've just won a copy of the [Freelance Switch](http://freelanceswitch.com/) e-book, *How To Be a Rockstar Freelancer*, thanks to the [contest](http://www.wakeuplater.com/free-stuff/free-stuff-friday-holiday-reading.aspx) run this week by [Wake Up Later](http://www.wakeuplater.com/)!  I'm pretty excited!  I'll let you all know how the book is after I get through it!
