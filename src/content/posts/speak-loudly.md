Have you ever thought about what gets valued more between content and actions?

In many marketing blogs there's been so much great discussion about how what content produce affects people's perceptions of you and your personal brand. From blogs to micro-messaging to this recent revival and shift to life-streaming by some big names like [Steve Rubel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Rubel).

What is it about content that makes it so compelling? And important for our perception?

It goes against that one so common phrase we all heard while growing up, *"Actions speak louder than words"*.

Maybe I've missed it, but when is the last time social media experts have dove in to how to best take action to help your brand?

Epiphany: **Good content creates action**.

Creating good content does speak volumes, because online we since we can all "make stuff", making great stuff is appreciated and it stands out. Not only that, what makes content so fulfilling online is the power that we as information consumers now have over content.

**Our ability to share content is what makes it so important, and powerful**. Our ability to share content,  and I don't think it goes much deeper than this, be them stories, experiences, or the opinions and ideas of others, is what makes content so powerful.

Through the sharing of content, we can inform, create ideas, create action, or change beliefs and behaviours. We do all this, coupled with the intrinsic benefit of sharing (our sharing with our readers, and their sharing with their friends, and so on).

From this perspective, we can see that the content you create, the blog posts or comments you write, contribute only a small amount to things like your brand, and that the bigger truth of it is that **you are represented by your impact on other people**.
