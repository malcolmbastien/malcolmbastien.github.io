Me:

Great piece. Sometimes I forget about that sort of thing, but while still not running ads, I don’t take advantage of my blog enough as a way to drive this extra value.

I have to remember to write TO my audience, and not just write what I think most people will find interesting and popular.

Dave Winer:

Malcolm, I don’t think so — just be yourself. It’s perfectly valid to use your blog as a notetaking tool, and unless there’s a reason not to, why not share your knowledge with everyone else. **There are all kinds of ways to profit from keeping a blog, one of them is knowing that [your blog] helped someone.** Money is only a means to an end, it’s not an end in itself. Obviously it’s an important means, but it’s not the only one.
