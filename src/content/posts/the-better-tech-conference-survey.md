I've taken my notes from the mind-map posted yesterday, and come up with a set of questions for my report on better tech conferences.

I've tried to keep the survey (and the amount of work I have to do) short, so the survey is only 25 multiple choice questions. Two areas I kept out of the questioning to keep things short were questions about conference content and theme. You can look back to my last post on the conference mind-map to see what ideas were organized within those to top level branches. 

Also, the survey results are all public.

Since this is only a class on writing reports, and not a class on how to run a good survey, I'm not asking any personal or demographic information (age, income, profession).

(After you hit submit, the iFrame will turn grey, scroll back up to see the confirmation message.)
