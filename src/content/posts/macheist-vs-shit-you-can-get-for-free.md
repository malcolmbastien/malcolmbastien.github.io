[MacHeist](http://www.macheist.com) just came out today with a collection of six applications for you to download completely for free for your Mac, with a combined total cost of $154. Here’s my 2 second breakdown.

**ShoveBox** [Evernote](http://evernote.com)

Just use Evernote

**WriteRoom** [Bean](http://www.bean-osx.com/Bean.html)/[Google Docs](http://docs.google.com/)

Bean and Google Docs both have nice distraction free full screen modes.

**Twitterrific** [Tweetie](http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/)

**TinyGrab**

*Automatically uploads your screenshots to the net and gives you a link on your Clipboard. Useful if you take a lot of screenshots. Not sure about a free equivalent anywhere.*

**Hordes of Orcs**

*In my opinion this is just a horrible tower defense game. Imagine, for you iPhone users out there, something that is 5% as good as Field Runners. Not sure about a free equivalent anywhere.*

**Mariner Write** [Bean](http://www.bean-osx.com/Bean.html)

You can do some layout options in Bean, how much they look alike makes me say just use bean.
