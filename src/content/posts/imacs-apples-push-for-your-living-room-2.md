Josh Davey: the new iMac 27"
Josh Davey: it's apple's plan to get in the living room and take over the TV
Josh Davey: the 27" allows you to use it as an external monitor and you can mount it on walls
Josh Davey: be default it comes with a mini wireless keyboard and mouse
Malcolm Bastien: That makes sense. I saw someone say that the price of the 20" cinema display is only $300 less than the 21.5" iMac
Josh Davey: crazy
Malcolm Bastien: pushing hard for iMacs
Malcolm Bastien: Are all the new iMacs wall mountable?
Josh Davey: just the 27" I believe
Josh Davey: "27-inch model can be attached to a wall mount, articulating arm, or other VESA-compliant mounting solution using the optional VESA Mount Adapter Kit"
Malcolm Bastien: what page do you see that on?
Josh Davey: http://www.apple.com/ca/imac/specs.html
Josh Davey: and dude... built in isight
Josh Davey: interactive TV
Josh Davey: or family conferencing in the living room
Josh Davey: speech recognition
Josh Davey: apple is smart
