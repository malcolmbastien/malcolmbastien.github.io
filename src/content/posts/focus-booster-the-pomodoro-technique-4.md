This looks like an amazing app. I have not had the time to download and try it out but I’m totally on it the first chance I get. It really reminds me of[ Merlin Mann’s Productivity Dash](http://www.43folders.com/2005/09/08/kick-procrastinations-ass-run-a-dash) which I use all the time. I’ve been looking for a good app for this and this looks like it could be the trick. (via a submission by [lionthegirl](http://lionthegirl.tumblr.com/))

This is something my frined Jaime Sorgente (@jsorgent) has gotten me on recently as well.
