The other day I finished reading [Keith Ferrazzi](http://www.keithferrazzi.com/)'s book [Never Eat Alone](http://www.keithferrazzi.com/theBook.html), and I have to say that it's been one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. One of the eye opening parts of the book that really resonated with me had to do with becoming the sort of person that has the qualities needed to carry through with all sorts of activities from: striking up conversations with important people, engaging in small talk, speaking at conferences, to becoming known as an authority and on the cutting edge.

All of that comes from an idea Keith talks about on how to be distinct from others, and from tying in your expertise with your personal brand.  The idea is about having "content".
