I’ve never used a task management app with sounds so much like Super Mario World. That has to be good right?

I like a few things about this app:

Those sound effects are fun and reward you for completing tasks.The ideas of priority and order are both taken care of by the neat colour gradient system.There’s very little to fus about in the app. It’s even simpler than Apple’s own Reminders app which I now base any iPhone task management app against.Everything is instant.I can’t wait for this to come out.
