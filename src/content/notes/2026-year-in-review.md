> I'm starting (and sharing) this post at the start of the year. My goal is to add to it as time goes by.

## Sprout

Sprout is the cleaned version of the [Astro](https://astro.build/) app that runs this site.

My initial goal was to have some way of sharing blog posts, without having to always go through the entire process of brainstormin.g, drafting and editing.

I took inspiration from the Digital Gardens others had created, piecing together parts that I liked and used AI to make something custom that fit what I wanted.

## Flow Focused

I migrated this blog away from WordPress, which this blog had run on since 2008, and with the help of AI, migrated it to [Astro](https://astro.build/).

I used AI to do all of the heavy lifting. For the setup and the design.

I used AI to export all my blog posts into markdown files, which lets me do all my writing and editing in [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).

I made a lot of this possible for me without having to learn multiple different systems. As a result, I spent a lot of time iterating the design. There were lots of little things the AI missed that I I needed to guide it to fix, but I also spent lots of time making little changes to parts I wasn't quite happy with.
