## Sprout

Sprout is the cleaned version of the Astro app that runs this site.

My initial goal was to have some way of sharing blog posts, without having to always go through the entire process of brainstorming, drafting and editting.

I took inspiration from the Digital Gardens others had created, piecing together parts that I liked and used AI to make something custom that fit what I wanted.
