Mozilla Drumbeat is about coming together to create, and volunteer on projects that support the open web. A consequence of working on open web projects is that we'll be forced to have many more discussions about the open web. Some projects will discuss open video, some projects open content and privacy, creative commons, etc..

If this is the case, then how can we make sure that the 100s or 1,000s of Drumbeat Projects are leading to discussions that are as productive in moving the web forward.

In the book Business Model Generation, Alexander Osterwalder presents the business model canvas as a visual tool to have better discussions about business models. I think we can do the same thing for the Open Web.

A model could help us identify open web applications from closed ones, it could help us cement the components of the various Drumbeat models, and it could break down successful open web business. Most importantly however is that it would provide a starting point for better open web discussions.

This is one of a few ideas I'm thinking about in preparation for Drumbeat Toronto on April 24th.
