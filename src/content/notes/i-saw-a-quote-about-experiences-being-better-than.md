I saw a quote about experiences being better than stories, because people remember experiences. Obviously that erqued me and I started thinking about it.

What I came up with is that stories are how we communicate, describe, and remember experiences. Story gives us the language we need to move up the pyramid.

Without stories all we have are research and insights, and the other work that goes into marketing. That work is ill suited to create brands or experiences though. Its the tools of story, that we’re evolutionary adept to, that let us create powerful interactions and brands.
I think this is one of the more powerful illustrations from this second set.
