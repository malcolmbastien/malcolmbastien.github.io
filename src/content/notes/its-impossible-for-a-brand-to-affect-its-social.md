It’s impossible for a brand to affect its social story, it can only impact consumers. It’s consumers who contribute to the social story through the experiences they have with a brand, and with 3rd party interactions like the things they see in the news, or the things they hear from friends.

The power of the social story is that it can reach consumers and affect them in ways brands can’t.

The social story is always active and ebbs and flows between positive and negative.
