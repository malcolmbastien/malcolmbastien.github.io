[Daring Fireball Linked List: Acer Chief Takes Aim at Microsoft Surface](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/08/07/acer-surface):

Here’s the problem for Acer and all the other PC makers — what alternatives? Linux? No one wants it. Android? Google’s in the hardware business now too. That’s why Microsoft can make this play — the PC makers have no leverage.

I read this and think that the death of the PC might more realistically be the end of the PC manufacturers.

If PCs (desktops and laptops) are needed less and less, what need does Microsoft have for a half dozen partners who all make the same product? No, PCs will be around, but there’ll be fewer of them. The ones that remain will be made by Apple and Microsoft.

The death of the PC will be felt most by companies like Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Samsung and Sony.
