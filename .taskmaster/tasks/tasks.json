        "details": "Create `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. Embed canvas with fixed width (288px) and height (512px). Implement a basic game loop function that clears and redraws the canvas on each frame.",

        "details": "Attach event listeners for keyboard (spacebar) and mouse clicks. On input, apply an instantaneous upward velocity to the bird. Implement logic to prevent the bird from going above the canvas top and to detect if it goes below the canvas bottom.",

        "details": "Develop a pipe object/class with properties for position, width, height, and gap position. Implement logic to randomly vary the vertical position of the gap while keeping its size constant. Manage an array of active pipes, adding new ones periodically and removing pipes that move completely off-screen to the left.",

        "details": "Implement a collision detection function that checks for overlap between the bird's bounding box and the bounding boxes of each pipe segment. Also, check for overlap with the canvas's bottom edge. Integrate this into the game loop to halt gameplay on collision.",
        "testStrategy": "Manually guide the bird into pipes and let it hit the ground to confirm that the game immediately stops and transitions to a game over state.",

        "details": "Maintain a score variable. Implement logic to detect when the bird's horizontal position has successfully passed a pipe's x-coordinate without collision. Render the current score as text on the canvas.",

        "details": "Define an enumeration or variable for game states. Implement logic to switch states based on user input (e.g., 'Press Space to Start') and game events (e.g., collision for Game Over). Render specific UI elements (text, buttons) for each state.",

        "details": "Apply basic CSS to center the canvas and set background colors. Use canvas drawing methods (e.g., `fillRect`, `arc`, `fillStyle`) to give the bird and pipes distinct, simple colors. Style the score and game state messages.",
