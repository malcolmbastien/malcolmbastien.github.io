		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Project Structure and Game Canvas",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the initialization of the project structure into creating the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, setting up the HTML canvas with specified dimensions, and implementing the core game loop using `requestAnimationFrame`.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves fundamental setup, including file creation, basic HTML/CSS for the canvas, and a standard JavaScript game loop. It's a straightforward starting point with no complex logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Bird Rendering and Gravity",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for implementing the bird, including defining its properties (position, velocity), drawing it as a simple shape on the canvas, and applying gravity through its update method to simulate continuous downward movement.",
			"reasoning": "Requires defining an object with properties, implementing a draw function, and applying basic physics (velocity and acceleration) within the game loop. It's foundational but introduces dynamic elements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Bird Flapping and Vertical Constraints",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline the process for adding user input to make the bird flap, including attaching event listeners for keyboard/mouse, applying an instantaneous upward velocity on input, and implementing vertical boundary checks to prevent the bird from going above the top edge and to trigger game over if it falls below the bottom edge.",
			"reasoning": "Combines user input handling, modification of physics properties (velocity), and critical game boundary logic. It's more interactive and introduces a game-over condition."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Pipe Generation and Horizontal Movement",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Describe the steps to implement pipe generation and movement, covering the creation of a Pipe object/class with properties, its rendering and constant horizontal movement, the logic for generating new pipes at regular intervals with randomly varied gap positions, and managing the array of active pipes (adding new, removing old).",
			"reasoning": "This task is complex due to managing multiple dynamic objects (pipes), implementing random generation with constraints, and handling object lifecycle (creation and removal). It's a core game mechanic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Bird-Pipe and Bird-Ground Collision Detection",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation of collision detection, including defining bounding boxes for the bird and each pipe segment, writing a robust collision detection function (e.g., AABB), and integrating these checks into the game loop to immediately trigger the game over state upon contact with pipes or the ground.",
			"reasoning": "Collision detection requires precise geometric calculations and careful integration into the game loop to ensure accuracy and immediate response. It's a critical game-over condition."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Scoring Logic and Display",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the scoring implementation into maintaining a score variable, implementing the specific logic to detect when the bird successfully passes through a pair of pipes without collision, and rendering the current score prominently as text on the canvas.",
			"reasoning": "While displaying text is simple, the logic for accurately detecting a 'pass' through pipes without collision adds a layer of complexity beyond simple increments."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Game State Management (Start, Playing, Game Over)",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline the implementation of game state management, including defining distinct states (Start, Playing, Game Over), managing transitions between them based on user input and game events (e.g., collision), and rendering appropriate UI elements (messages, restart options) for each state, ensuring the game loop adapts to the current state.",
			"reasoning": "This task orchestrates the entire game flow, requiring careful management of what is rendered and updated in different scenarios. It ties together many previously implemented features and is crucial for a complete game experience."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Apply Basic Visual Refinements and Styling",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for applying basic visual refinements, including using CSS to center the canvas and set background colors, and employing canvas drawing methods (e.g., `fillRect`, `arc`, `fillStyle`) to give the bird, pipes, score, and game state messages distinct, simple colors and a clean appearance.",
			"reasoning": "Primarily aesthetic, but requires knowledge of both CSS for page layout and canvas drawing APIs for in-game elements. It's about making the existing elements look presentable."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Performance and Test Browser Compatibility",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Describe the process for optimizing performance and ensuring browser compatibility, including profiling the game's performance in developer tools to identify and address any bottlenecks, and conducting thorough testing across major evergreen browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) to catch rendering or JavaScript API inconsistencies.",
			"reasoning": "Performance optimization and cross-browser testing can be time-consuming and require specific tools and debugging skills. It's about refining the technical quality of the game."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Prepare for GitHub Pages Deployment",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline the steps to prepare the project for GitHub Pages deployment, ensuring `index.html` is in the root directory, all CSS and JavaScript file paths are relative and correct, and verifying successful deployment and accessibility via a public URL after pushing to a GitHub repository.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard deployment task, primarily involving file path verification and using a platform's built-in deployment features. It's generally straightforward for web projects."
