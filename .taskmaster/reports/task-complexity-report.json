		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Astro Project and Tailwind CSS",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the initialization into environment setup, package installation, and foundational directory structure creation.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard initialization task using official CLI tools. It is straightforward but requires correct configuration of SSG and Tailwind integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Define Content Collection Schema",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Identify subtasks for defining the Zod schema in config.ts and creating a mock content entry to validate the schema.",
			"reasoning": "Astro's Content Collections are robust. Defining the schema is simple, but ensuring the Zod validation correctly handles optional dates and enum statuses requires careful testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Markdown Post Rendering and Layout",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate the layout creation, the dynamic route setup ([...slug].astro), and the implementation of metadata rendering (title, status badges).",
			"reasoning": "Requires understanding Astro's routing and getStaticPaths. Handling Markdown rendering with proper layout wrapping is a core but manageable task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Semantic Concept Block Components",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: research/selection of remark-directive or similar plugin, CSS pattern implementation, Astro component creation, and integration into the Markdown pipeline.",
			"reasoning": "Adding custom syntax processing to Markdown (like callouts or directives) typically requires configuring Remark or Rehype plugins, which increases technical complexity over standard UI work."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Git Evolution Tracker Module",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Focus on library integration (simple-git), data transformation (formatting commit logs), and error handling for uncommitted files.",
			"reasoning": "Interfacing with the file system and Git history adds an external dependency and requires handling environment-specific behavior (e.g., CI environments having shallow clones)."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Build Post History UI Component",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline tasks for UI design (timeline view) and data binding between the Git module and the Astro component.",
			"reasoning": "Purely a UI task once Task 5 is completed. The complexity lies in the visual presentation of the timeline."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create Maturity-based Filtering and Homepage",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: fetching and sorting content, implementing the filtering logic/state, and styling the status-based badges.",
			"reasoning": "Standard collection filtering. Since Astro is primarily static, filtering logic must either be handled at build time (multiple pages) or via client-side JS/islands."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop GitHub-style Activity Heatmap",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for aggregating repository-wide commit data, calculating intensity levels, generating the SVG grid, and implementing tooltips.",
			"reasoning": "This is the most algorithmically complex UI task. It requires processing a large set of dates and mapping them to a fixed SVG grid with varying color intensities."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Configure GitHub Actions Deployment",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Define tasks for YAML workflow configuration and setting up the base/site URL variables in astro.config.mjs.",
			"reasoning": "Astro has excellent documentation and pre-built actions for GitHub Pages. Complexity is low, provided the SSG configuration is correct."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Final UI Polish and Profile Header",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down by: ProfileHeader component creation, global theme alignment (color palette), and final cross-browser visual QA.",
			"reasoning": "Mainly aesthetic refinement and aggregation of stats. Requires careful CSS work to achieve the 'GitHub-lite' look-and-feel consistently."
