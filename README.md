# Welcome!

I'm currently experimenting with various tools, including the [Zed editor](https://zed.dev/).

## Tools I'm Trying:

*   Zed: A high-performance, multiplayer code editor. [zed.dev](https://zed.dev/)
*   VS Codium: A free and open-source build of the VS Code editor without Microsoft's telemetry. [vscodium.com](https://vscodium.com/)
*   Opde Code: An AI-powered coding assistant. [opencode.ai](https://opencode.ai/)

Stay tuned for more updates!
