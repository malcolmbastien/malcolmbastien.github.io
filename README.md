# Welcome!

This site serves as a public log of my experiments and explorations with various tools, particularly focusing on emerging technologies such as AI agents, AI CLIs, large language models (LLMs), and AI code assistants.

## Tools I'm Trying:

*   [Zed](https://zed.dev/): A high-performance, multiplayer code editor.
*   [VS Codium](https://vscodium.com/): A free and open-source build of the VS Code editor without Microsoft\'s telemetry.
*   [Open Code](https://opencode.ai/): An AI-powered coding assistant.
*   [Task-Master-AI](https://www.task-master.dev/): A tool for managing and automating development tasks based on product requirements.
*   [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli): A command-line interface for interacting with Google Gemini.
*   [Gemini Code Assist](https://codeassist.google/): An AI-powered code completion and generation tool from Google.
*   [Kilo Code](https://kilocode.ai/): An open-source AI agent VS Code extension that combines features of Cline, Roo, and its own additions, offering orchestrator, architect, code, and debug modes.
*   [Roo Code](https://roocode.com/): An AI-powered dev team in VS Code that helps write, refactor, and debug code across multiple files with specialized modes and deep project context.
*   [Ollama](https://ollama.com/): A tool for running large language models locally.
*   [Open Router](https://openrouter.ai/): A unified API for AI models.

Stay tuned for more updates!
